## Installation
- Import project to Eclipse (File > Import > Projects from Git).
- Switch Eclipse to Navigator view, so you will be able to see hidden files (Window > Show View > Navigator).
- In the root directory create file `.classpath`- it should contain paths to your local mysql and servlet-api. Example can be seen in `sample_classpath`.
- Set your own database credentials at /src/database/Connector.java
